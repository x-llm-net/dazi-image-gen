**A complete AI image creation workflow for DeepSeek Harness.**

`dazi-image-gen` goes far beyond basic in-chat image generation. It brings **in-chat generation with continuous editing**, an **AI creative canvas**, **Studio batch creation**, **side-by-side multi-model comparison**, a **prompt inspiration library**, and **local ComfyUI** workflows into DSH.

It supports mainstream cloud image models and private local workflows, works with BYOK (bring your own key) or subscription accounts, and can isolate generated assets by workspace.

### Dazi workbench fork

This repository is the Dazi workbench image plugin. Its npm package is `dazi-image-gen`, deliberately separate from the upstream `dsh-image-gen`. The Dazi layer only binds the image provider to the native workbench model settings; it does not copy API keys or replace the Harness Agent, permissions, or file tools.

After installation in Dazi, the image settings card shows **Dazi model**. It reads the provider and model list already configured under **Settings → Models**, so the image plugin only needs a model selection—no second Base URL or API key. The default provider id is `xiaowen-runtime`, with `gpt-image-2.5` as the default image model.

For normal users, open the **Plugins** page from Dazi's sidebar, choose **Add plugin**, and paste:

```text
git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git
```

If the upstream `dsh-image-gen` is already installed, disable or uninstall it from **Plugins → Installed** before enabling this Dazi plugin. They are separate packages but expose overlapping image tools; Xiaowen model credentials remain in **Settings → Models** and do not need to be entered again.

Or run this in the profile terminal:

```bash
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git
```

After installation, click **Enable now** in the result, then open the plugin settings under **Installed**. GitHub is only the distribution source; Dazi's native plugin manager handles installation, activation, disabling, and removal.

> **Already paying for ChatGPT, Grok, or Google? Just sign in and start generating—no separate API key purchase needed.**

Supports: Gemini · OpenAI / Compatible · Seedream · DashScope · Grok Imagine · GLM-Image · Local ComfyUI

```bash
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git
```

> **Update notice:** This release includes major changes. Existing users should update to the latest version.

## One plugin, the complete AI image creation workflow

| Entry | Best for | What you can do |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 💬 **Chat** | Expressing ideas quickly | Text-to-image, image-to-image, continuous editing, and revision iteration |
| ✏️ **Canvas** | Expressing visual creativity | Sketch-to-image, reference composition, spatial creation, and continuous refinement |
| 🎛️ **Studio** | Fine-grained control over creation parameters | Batch generation, multi-image reference, and advanced parameter tuning |
| ✨ **Inspiration** | Finding creative direction | Prompt examples, style exploration, and one-click reuse |
| 🖼️ **Gallery** | Managing generated results | Search, favorite, download, and reuse |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

Requirements: Dazi workbench (based on DeepSeek Harness), Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>= 24.0.0`.

If the upstream `dsh-image-gen` is already installed, disable or uninstall it from **Plugins → Installed** first; the two packages expose overlapping image tools.

Run this command in the Dazi profile terminal:

```bash
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git
```

The plugin manager may ask you to approve the package build script. This is pnpm's safety prompt for building a GitHub source package and is required for the first install.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative installation methods (global / GitHub / local development)</strong></summary>

```bash
# If dsh is installed globally:
dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git

# Install the latest source directly from GitHub:
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git

# Clone the repository and install it for local development:
git clone https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add ./dazi-image-gen
```

</details>

### 2. Choose an image model

After installing and enabling the plugin, open the **Plugins** page from the sidebar and select **dazi-image-gen** under **Installed**. The default **Dazi model** reuses the Xiaowen provider and credentials from Model settings, so you do not need to enter another API key or Base URL. Click **Fetch models**, choose an available image model (for example, `gpt-image-2.5`), and save.

To use ComfyUI, another cloud provider, or a subscription login, expand the corresponding provider settings and follow the prompts there.

### 3. Start creating

Describe the image you want directly in chat:

```text
Create a cinematic cyberpunk cat on a neon street at night, 16:9.
```

You can also upload a reference image directly for style transfer or editing:

```text
Keep the character and composition unchanged, then add black sunglasses to the cat.
```

## Core Capabilities

### 💬 In-chat generation, editing, and revision switching

- Use natural language for text-to-image, image-to-image, multi-image reference, and style transfer.
- Edit the original prompt to regenerate, then switch between revisions on the same image card.

<br />

  <br />
  <sub>Regenerate in place after editing the prompt, then switch between previous results on the same image card.</sub>
</div>

<br />

### ✏️ From sketch to image: AI creative canvas

Express your ideas on an infinite canvas and turn drafts, compositions, and thoughts into real images through conversation.

- Freely sketch, add reference materials, and organize your ideas on the canvas.
- Talk to the AI in natural language to turn a draft into a finished piece.
- Keep editing, refining, and exploring new directions from existing results—your creative process is preserved so every exploration stays iterable.

  <br />
  <sub>Left: Sketch and place reference images on the canvas, then generate through conversation. · Right: Keep iterating on existing results through conversation.</sub>
</div>

<br />

### 🎛️ Studio batch creation

- Support multiple reference images, and generate multiple candidates at a time.
- Control the Provider, model, aspect ratio, and quality, then save only the results you want.

<br />

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/studio-workbench.webp" alt="dazi-image-gen Studio workbench" width="100%" />
  <br />
  <sub>Import references, control parameters, generate batches, select results, and save—all within one Studio.</sub>
</div>

<br />

### ⚖️ Side-by-side multi-model comparison

Run the same prompt and reference images across multiple models, then compare and save the results on one canvas.

<br />

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/multi-model-compare.webp" alt="Comparing the same prompt across multiple image models" width="100%" />
  <br />
  <sub>Compare results from different models on one canvas, then save the images you prefer in a batch.</sub>
</div>

<br />

### ✨ 500+ prompt inspiration examples

- Browse and filter **500+ prompt examples**, then favorite, copy, or send them directly to Studio.
- Images are cached locally, so browsing and learning consume no tokens or generation quota.

<br />

  <img src="docs/assets/readme/inspiration-library.webp" alt="Prompt inspiration library" width="100%" />
  <br />
  <sub>Find inspiration first, then send a prompt to Studio. Browsing and copying from the local cache consume no generation quota.</sub>
</div>

<br />

### 🖼️ Gallery, favorites, and batch management

- Manage images saved from chat and Studio in one place, isolated by workspace.
- Search, filter, favorite, download, continue editing, regenerate, and batch-manage results.

<br />

<div align="center">

  <br />
  <sub>Filter, favorite, and batch-manage gallery items while keeping data isolated by workspace.</sub>
</div>

<br />

### 🧩 Multiple local ComfyUI workflows

Bring private image generation on your local GPU directly into Agent conversations.

- Import and manage multiple named workflows with prompt presets and common placeholders.
- Let the Agent select a workflow by name for text-to-image or image-to-image generation in chat.

> ComfyUI is not yet integrated into Studio or multi-model comparison.

> Studio and multi-model comparison currently support cloud Providers only (subscription channels included). Multi-model comparison uses the model configured for each Provider in Settings.
> Zhipu GLM-Image does not support image-to-image upstream. xAI image editing goes through the OpenAI-compatible protocol (multipart); some gateways may need further adaptation.
> Subscription channels work through account sign-in (no API key). They support in-chat text-to-image / image-to-image, Studio batch generation, and multi-model comparison; edits ride each channel's edit endpoint (up to 5 reference images), with aspect ratio and quality selectable directly in Studio.

> An `auto` ratio lets the model pick the framing from the prompt; tiers the upstream dropped (e.g. Seedream 5.0's 1K) are never exposed.
> OpenAI Compatible (relay) pickers are driven by the `openaiCompatSizes` setting, shaped as ratio → tier → pixels, e.g. `{ "16:9": { "2K": "2048x1152" } }`; an empty table keeps the legacy 1:1 / 3:2 / 2:3 + standard behavior.

## Data and Privacy

- **BYOK:** API keys are stored through the DSH Credentials service and are never displayed in plaintext on the settings page.
- **Subscription sign-in:** Subscription tokens are saved in DSH Credentials after your authorized sign-in, fully isolated from API keys; the browser side never touches a token.
- **Cloud requests:** The prompt and reference images used for a request are sent to the selected Provider. Follow that Provider's terms of service.
- **Local ComfyUI:** Requests are sent to the configured ComfyUI address.
- **Workspace files:** When workspace saving is enabled, chat results are written to disk; Studio saves only the candidates you select.
- **Gallery and favorites:** Gallery metadata and favorite state are stored in the current browser's local storage.
- **Inspiration cache:** Example metadata ships with the plugin. Images load on demand and are cached locally, and the cache can be cleared at any time.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What should I do if “Image Generation” is missing after installation?</strong></summary>

Open the **Plugins** page from the sidebar and select dazi-image-gen under **Installed**. Older Harness versions may place plugin settings under **Settings → Plugin Configuration**.

If it is missing in both places, fully restart the current DSH Profile, then inspect the plugin configuration:

```bash
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

If `dazi-image-gen` is absent from the output, run the installation command again. When filing an issue, include the DSH version, plugin version, and relevant error logs, but never include your API key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are generated images saved?</strong></summary>

When “Save to workspace” is enabled, chat results are saved to the `dazi-image-gen/` subdirectory of the current workspace by default. You can change this directory in Settings. Studio candidates remain on the temporary canvas until you select which results should enter the gallery and be saved.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is ComfyUI not available in Studio?</strong></summary>

Studio and multi-model comparison currently support cloud Providers only; ComfyUI is not yet integrated. ComfyUI supports text-to-image, single-image editing, and multiple named workflows through Agent chat.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does deleting an item from the gallery remove its chat message?</strong></summary>

No. Deleting a gallery record does not modify the original chat message. You may separately choose to remove the corresponding local image file from the workspace. File deletion is normally irreversible, so confirm carefully.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I upgrade?</strong></summary>

```bash
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/x-llm-net/dazi-image-gen.git
```

Enable the updated plugin in the plugin manager. If the page does not update, restart the Dazi workbench.
